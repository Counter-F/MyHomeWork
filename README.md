<p>bolded text</p>

**The term  "Big Data" refers to the evolution and use of technologies that provide  the right user at the right time with the right information from a mass  of data that has been growing exponentially for a long time in our  society. The challenge is not only to deal with rapidly increasing  volumes of data but also the difficulty of managing increasingly  heterogeneous formats as well as increasingly complex and interconnected data.**  



<p>italicized text</p>

*Big Data is a very difficult concept to define precisely since the very notion of  big in terms of volume of data varies from one area to another. It is  not defined by a set of technologies, on the contrary, it defines a  category of techniques and technologies. This is an emerging field, and  as we seek to learn how to implement this new paradigm and harness the  value, the definition is changing.*

~~Being a  complex polymorphic object, its definition varies according to the  communities that are interested in it as a user or provider of services. Invented by the giants of the web, Big Data presents itself as a  solution designed to provide everyone real-time access to giant  databases.~~
